# GIFS

I was instructed with the following task during my time at the UNCC Coding Bootcamp


    ### Overview

    In this assignment, you'll use the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of your choice.
    To finish this task, you must call the GIPHY API and use JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of your site.


This app is designed to easily access GIFs of a certain famous singer. A user can press on a singers name to see the GIFs 
of that singer. A user can also add new singers to the list of singers.


Checkout the screenshot to see what the app looks like.
